## ABOUT THE PROJECT 
### * INTRODUCTION 
This Project is aimed to solve the problems of beginner and intermeddiate programmers whose want to collaborate with other like minded individuals over any project, In this way 2 or more completely unknown persons with similar skill-sets and willing to do a project or collaboration can find themselves on the platform and team up to proceed about it.

### * WHAT IT DOES
This application(currently in web form) is an end-to-end solution for anyone willing to find similar people with similar intrest to find(**it suggests individual based on similar intrests and skill sets by A CUSTOM ALGORITHM**) , collaborate (**Create a group with 2 or more person , chat , video and audio calling , also code sharing via chat**) and display their work(**A news feed consisting posts of individuals**).  

### * HOW DOES IT WORKS
Firstly users will register and login on the page website, the information filled by them is typically a combination of 2 types of information , one consists of more contact related informations and other one has more experienced and skill-set level information, Based on the similarity of second type of information we suggest other persons with similar skill-set or someone can also search individuals for a particular label. Then the individuals audit the persons and send them a **collaborate-request** with a compulsory message(with purpose of collaboration) then the indiviuals can see all the pending collaborate-requests and accept the ones they like and as soon as they accept a chat group will be created and they can start brainstorming and contributing
